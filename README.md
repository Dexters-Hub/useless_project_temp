### Project Description
A fun, slightly clueless chatbot friend. It doesn‚Äôt always get things right, but it‚Äôs here to keep you entertained with unpredictable answers. Perfect for a lighthearted chat, not perfect answers!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Today's generation always depends on AI tools like chatGPT,copilot etc for every needs rather than using their own brain for creative ideas.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for) 
A playful chatbot that gives imperfect answers to spark creative thinking. It encourages users to rely on their own ideas instead of depending on AI for every solution.
